# Android-forced-app-optimization
This project is a bat file that you can run on your windows machine, it uses ADB and an user friendly menu to optimize all the apps on your android device. I made this tool because the optimization always takes place when the device is idle and it's fully charged, and I don't want to charge my device to 100%.
The menu has the options:
1. Check ADB connection (List devices)
2. All packages optimization speed-profile
3. All packages full optimization
4. Clearing profile data for all packages


In the folder "android-device" there are .sh files that can be run on android so you can optimize your device on itself, to run them you need root permission.
